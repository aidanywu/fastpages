    "# Ways to recommend songs based on song features\n",
    "To calculate similar songs based on features of a given song, we used the data available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vatsalmavani/spotify-dataset).\n",
    "Note: This dataset appears to only have data for songs up to 2021 or 2022.\n",
    "Some options (that I found) that calculates distances between songs are:\n",
    "  - Cosine similarity\n",
    "  - Manhattan distance\n",
    "  - Euclidean distance\n",
    "  - Minkowski distance"

    "I decided to use cosine similarity because cosine similarity calculates the angle, or how vectors are pointed relatively to each other. Therefore, even though songs can be very different in magnitudes of features, as long as the features together points to a similar direction, these songs can still be very similar and recommended. Cosine similarity also ignores 0 to 0 matches and seems to be very popular in recommendation systems. Though this might only be true for text analysis since magnitudes are usually very different in that. Regardless, I used cosine similarity even though a distance measurement that uses magnitude might actually be better here since the values are already on a scale of 0-1"
