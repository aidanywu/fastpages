# Notes
* Ds in school but still went to CSUSM
  * various pathways such as computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, robotics, and STEM
* Mechanical engineering is heavily based in physics, and many students at Cal State San Marcos go through this program
* Being involved in clubs and internships is important during undergraduate years, and internships can also help in determining one's interests and exposing them to experiences
  * Internships are also an important way to be a part of research and get into college
  * Google along with school events can be used to find so many different internship opportunities
* Scholarships can be found for various interests, and it is possible to get paid to pursue these interests
  * Scholarships exist for a lot things
* College debt is a real and scary thing, and there are two types of loans: subsidized loans, which are provided by the government, and unsubsidized loans, which are not based on financial aid for undergraduate and graduate students.


# Reflection
Learning about how someone who got Ds is now studying for a Ph.D was interesting but more so inspiring. I do plan on going into computer science, but I highly doubt that I will be going to CSUSM since I'm aiming for to better university. However, although universities differ quite a lot, some experiences and knowledge that will be learned in universities can be universally. And in this event, I learned a lot about that. For example, there are subsidized and unsubsidized scholarships. Additionally, universities can share similar departments and clubs. I did disagree with her statement that any internships that do not pay are not worth it since at our age, if money isn't a huge issue, there are a lot of good unpaid internships where you do a lot of good research. The experience in those internships can be more valuable than the money earned at others. I also learned about ways that you could go for internships, such as at college events, if I ever want any more internships. I also did not realize that you get paid as a graduate doing research for the university so that looks a more appealing now. Learning about her experience at her research lab in CSUSM has encouraged me more to join one when I get to college. Overall, this event was pretty informing, learning about life after high school.
