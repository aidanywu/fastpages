title: CSUMU Event Reflection

# Reflection
Learning about how someone who got Ds is now studying for a Ph.D was interesting. I do plan on going into computer science, but I highly doubt that I will be going to CSUSM since I'm aiming for to better university. However, although universities differ quite a lot, some experiences and knowledge that will be learned in universities can be universally. And in this event, I learned a lot about that. For example, there are subsidized and unsubsidized scholarships. Additionally, universities can share similar departments and clubs. I did disagree with her statement that any internships that do not pay are not worth it since at our age, if money isn't a huge issue, there are a lot of good unpaid internships where you do a lot of good research. The experience in those internships can be more valuable than the money earned at others. I also learned about ways that you could go for internships, such as at college events, if I ever want any more internships. I also did not realize that you get paid as a graduate doing research for the university so that looks a more appealing now. Learning about her experience at her research lab in CSUMU has encouraged me more to join one when I get to college. Overall, this event was pretty informing, learning about life after high school.
