# Corrections
## Question 30

The answer was D because the column goes backwards so 15, 25, 35, 45 are all printed first.

## Question 38

The answer was D because When i has the value 4, temp is assigned the value "l". When i has the value 3, "p" is appended to temp, resulting in "lp". When i has the value 2, "p" is appended to temp again, resulting in "lpp". In the last iteration of the for loop, i has the value 1 and "a" is appended to temp, resulting in "lppa".

## Question 47

In the body of the first if clause in the code segment, b1 retains the value true if num is between 0 and 100, exclusive. In the body of the else clause, b1 retains the value true if num is less than -100. The statement assigns true to b2 if num is less than -100 or between 0 and 100, exclusive.
