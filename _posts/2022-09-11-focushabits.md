# Notes and Reflection
* Students are often too stressed and overwhelmed in school
* Putting off work isn't good for our health
* Appreciate the smaller things and the present in life
* Goals are helpful
* Learn to take breaks and do something you like


# Goals
* Stop putting APUSH notes off until Thursday since it will take many hours to do
* Better balance between academics, athletics, and sleep
