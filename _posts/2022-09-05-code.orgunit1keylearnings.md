title: Week 2 Innovation -- Using Objects
---
# Key Learnings
* Creating and using objects
  * use "public class" to create a class
    * Within the class, use "public" to define methods that can used outside and inside the class and "private" to define methods that can only be used within the class.
    * "void" is used to specify that the respective method does not return anything
    * "static" means that no matter how many times the method is initialized, it will only be created once, therefore all instances created shares a single field. It belongs to itself instead of an instance.
  * use "[Class Name] [Variable Name] = new [Class Name] ();" to create new object of the specified class
  * use period (.) after object variable to use its method
* Extend
  * "extends" makes the class defined before it a subclass of the superclass (an already defined class you are extending) that is defined after "extends"
  * The subclass inherits all of the superclass's attributes
