## Question 15
![q15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56620132/200247821-2afbceae-4ae3-4f1b-b8ed-4d357952c812.png)
I did not see the else return true statement and the return statement would terminate the program so if the first two were in increasing order but the rest weren't it would still return true

## Question 22

I did not realize that subclasses can be assigned to subclass type variables. I also did not know that even though AudioBook is able to be assigned, it would still be considered a Book object in books regardless.

## Question 24

I look at the 2 in newArray[0][2] and accidentally thought it was column 2 instead of the third one because it starts at 0. I also somehow thought it was talking about the second row when it was literally a 0.
