I do plan on going into computer science, but I highly doubt that I will be going to CSUSM since I’m aiming for to better university. However, although universities differ quite a lot, some experiences and knowledge that will be learned in universities can be universally. And in this event, I learned a lot about that. For example, there are subsidized and unsubsidized scholarships. Additionally, universities can share similar departments and clubs. I did disagree with her statement that any internships that do not pay are not worth it since at our age, if money isn’t a huge issue, there are a lot of good unpaid internships where you do a lot of good research. The experience in those internships can be more valuable than the money earned at others. I also learned about ways that you could go for internships, such as at college events, if I ever want any more internships. I also did not realize that you get paid as a graduate doing research for the university so that looks a more appealing now. Learning about her experience at her research lab in CSUMU has encouraged me more to join one when I get to college. Overall, this event was pretty informing, learning about life after high school.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Java RapidAPI</title><link href="https://willcyber.github.io/fastpages/jupyter/2023/03/28/api.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Java RapidAPI" /><published>2023-03-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://willcyber.github.io/fastpages/jupyter/2023/03/28/api</id><author><name></name></author><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[api test]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week 26 Collections</title><link href="https://willcyber.github.io/fastpages/jupyter/2023/03/19/collections.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 26 Collections" /><published>2023-03-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://willcyber.github.io/fastpages/jupyter/2023/03/19/collections</id><author><name></name></author><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week 25 Datatypes</title><link href="https://willcyber.github.io/fastpages/jupyter/2023/03/13/datatypes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 25 Datatypes" /><published>2023-03-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://willcyber.github.io/fastpages/jupyter/2023/03/13/datatypes</id><author><name></name></author><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Binary Addition</title><link href="https://willcyber.github.io/fastpages/jupyter/2023/03/06/binaryaddition.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Binary Addition" /><published>2023-03-06T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-03-06T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://willcyber.github.io/fastpages/jupyter/2023/03/06/binaryaddition</id><author><name></name></author><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
